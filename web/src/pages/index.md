# SMART AIR HOCKEY TABLE

## Project Description

The Smart Air Hockey Table replicates the functionalities of a traditional arcade air hockey setup with a twist. The notable innovation is the incorporation of a responsive surface beneath a translucent playfield. This reactive surface, comprising strategically positioned lights, sensors, and computational components, reacts in real-time to the movements of the puck, generating visual displays that enhance the gameplay experience.

A tuned grid of Hall effect sensors lies beneath the playing field of the Smart Air Hockey Table. These sensors measure disturbances in the magnetic field caused by a magnet embedded within the puck. Microcontrollers within the table read the values generated by these Hall effect sensors and process the data to get an accurate position of the puck in real-time.

A grid of RGB LEDs also lies beneath the playing field of the Smart Air Hockey Table. These RGB LEDs operate as an optional backlight for the playing field with variable colors and intensity. However, each RGB LED can be individually controlled, allowing for almost limitless complex visuals. When combined with puck tracking and the game state, these visuals become reactive to the gameplay.

Beside these innovative features, the Smart Air Hockey Table retains all the typical features consumers expect from a recreational air hockey table designed for residential use. This includes robust goal detection using photoresistors and an LCD integrated into the table for displaying the current score and game state.

The dynamic nature of the reactive surface introduces novel game modes that transcend the boundaries of conventional air hockey. Despite its technologically advanced features, the smart air hockey table maintains a compact form factor, making it adaptable to a variety of flat surfaces, from regular tables to other suitable platforms. This convergence of timeless gameplay with modern technological advancements is poised to redefine the enjoyment of air hockey, offering enthusiasts an immersive and unparalleled gaming encounter.

## Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs)

The design and development of the smart air hockey table will adhere to the
following focused design requirements to ensure a successful and captivating
gameplay experience:

1. PSDR #1 (Hardware): 
An ability to control a grid of RGB LEDs beneath the playing surface with a refresh rate of [TODO].
2. PSDR #2 (Hardware & Software):
An ability to track the puckâ€™s position on the playing field with a maximum average latency of [TODO].
3. PSDR #3 (Hardware):
An ability to reliably detect goals scored by monitoring the passage of the puck through the goal using a photoresistor and LED pair.
4. PSDR #4 (Hardware):
An ability to internally track the score of ongoing games, which is then displayed with an LCD display.
5. PSDR #5 (Software):
An ability to display dynamic light effects on the playing surface based on game state by implementing software that synchronizes visual effects with ongoing gameplay.
