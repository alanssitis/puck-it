# SMART AIR HOCKEY TABLE

## Project Description

The Smart Air Hockey Table (SAHT) redefines the classic arcade game, offering
an immersive experience like no other. Central to its advanced gameplay is a
vibrant grid of RGB LEDs, dynamically illustrating the puck's position and game
events. This real-time interactivity is made possible by a carefully arrayed set
of hall effect sensors, which pinpoint the puck's every move. Additionally,
photoresistors are integrated for impeccable goal detection, ensuring each score
is accurately registered.

The hall effect sensors are strategically embedded beneath the translucent
playing field in a grid pattern. These sensors detect changes in magnetic
fields. As the puck, equipped with a small magnet, glides across the surface,
the sensors underneath identify its precise location by sensing the magnetic
field changes caused by the puck's movement. The density and layout of this grid
ensure the puck's position is determined with high accuracy, allowing the system
to provide real-time feedback. For instance, as the puck moves, the individually
controlled LEDs beneath the surface illuminate its path, creating a mesmerizing
trail effect that enhances the overall gaming experience.

This grid-based hall effect sensor system not only offers unparalleled precision
in puck tracking but also enables the microcontroller to interpret rapid changes
in direction and speed. Such granular detail ensures that dynamic visuals
generated by the LEDs are always synchronized with the puck's position and
movement. Players, therefore, experience a highly responsive and visually rich
gameplay, where the table reacts instantly to every twist and turn of the puck.

Combined with other features like the OLED score display and photoresistor-based
goal detection, the SAHT offers an intuitive yet futuristic air hockey
experience. It seamlessly merges traditional gameplay with modern tech
enhancements, ensuring that both newcomers and seasoned players are treated to
an unmatched recreational encounter.

## Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs)

The design and development of the smart air hockey table will adhere to the
following focused design requirements to ensure a successful and captivating
gameplay experience:

1. PSDR #1 (Hardware): An ability to efficiently and quickly compress the
   signals from a large grid of hall effect switches under the playing surface
   using digital gates to just row and column bit vectors. These are connected
   to the microcontroller and used to determine the puck position.
2. PSDR #2 (Hardware): An ability to reliably detect goals scored by monitoring
   the passage of the puck through the goal slots using a photoresistor and LED
   pair. The sensors will be connected to the microcontroller and will trigger
   an update in game state.
3. PSDR #3 (Hardware): An ability to display game score stored in a
   microcontroller on an OLED display using the SPI protocol.
4. PSDR #4 (Hardware): An ability to control a large grid of
   individually-addressable RGB LEDs (WS2812B) beneath the playing surface using
   the microcontroller via a serialized PWM communication protocol.
5. PSDR #5 (Hardware): An ability to step down a voltage of 5V down to 3.3V
   using a buck converter to power the microcontroller.
