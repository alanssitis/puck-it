            <h2>Project Name: Smart Air Hockey Table</h2>
			
            <h2>Project Description:</h2>
            The project at hand involves the development of a smart air hockey table that replicates the functionalities of a traditional arcade air hockey setup with a twist. The notable innovation is the incorporation of a responsive surface beneath a translucent playfield. This reactive surface, comprising strategically positioned lights, sensors, and computational components, reacts in real-time to the movements of the puck, generating visual displays that enhance the gameplay experience.
            <br>
            The dynamic nature of the reactive surface introduces novel game modes that transcend the boundaries of conventional air hockey. Despite its technologically advanced features, the smart air hockey table maintains a compact form factor, making it adaptable to a variety of flat surfaces, from regular tables to other suitable platforms. This convergence of timeless gameplay with modern technological advancements is poised to redefine the enjoyment of air hockey, offering enthusiasts an immersive and unparalleled gaming encounter.

            
            <h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2> The design and development of the smart air hockey table will adhere to the following focused design requirements to ensure a successful and captivating gameplay experience:
                <ol>
                    <li>PSDR #1 (Hardware): An ability to control a grid of lights beneath the playing surface to create complex visuals.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #2 (Hardware & Software): An ability to accurately track the puckâ€™s position on the playing field in real time.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #3 (Hardware): An ability to reliably detect goals scored by monitoring the passage of the puck through the goal.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #4 (Hardware): An ability to internally track the score of ongoing games, which is then displayed with a display.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #5 (Software): An ability to display dynamic light effects on the playing surface based on game state by implementing software that synchronizes visual effects with ongoing gameplay.</li>
                </ol>
