This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, posted on Brightspace.  

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            I spent most of these two weeks doing background research and helping complete team tasks relating to the project.  Most of my expertise relates to my past embedded experience, so I have been using most of this time to brainstorm potential solutions to the numerous engineering challenges and helping define constraints for our finished project.
						<br/>
						<b>Background research</b><br/>
						Most of the background research I did over these first two weeks related to feasibility analysis for various components.  Due to the scale and complexity of our table, I investigated different possible solutions for puck tracking, communication, and LED manipulation.  I analyzed prices and datasheets for various sensors, checked what parts we could potentially obtain for free using the ECE shop catalog, and brainstormed a few solutions for high speed communication of dozens of microcontrollers.  Heading into the next few weeks, this research will be tested for real-world feasibility.
						<br/>
						<b>Team Meetings</b><br/>
						Our team held a few meetings to work on the team assignments.  These meetings were mostly used to outline each member's responsibility and split the work according to our strengths, but we also brainstormed ideas for our tables.  Much of the time spent in these meetings is described in the other two sections for this week's progress report.
						<br/>
						<b>Team Assignments</b><br/>
						The first two weeks had both the revised initial project proposal, final project proposal, and the function specifications due.  I spent a lot of time revising our initial proposal, primarily researching and decsribing a more relevant existing product to include in our market research section of the document.  For the final project proposal, I primarily helped with the initial budget estimation, using hypothetical parts and current market pricing to create a rough price estimate for our project.
