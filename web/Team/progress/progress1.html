            <h4>Weeks 1 & 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b>Sep 1, 2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b>16<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            I have spent most of the past two weeks working on the design and
            technical specifications of the project. Most of this process was
            on a shared whiteboard in the lab. I also set up some of the
            infrastructure the team will be using for the remainder of the
            semester. I will be writing a lot of what has been discussed to
            the team's documentation in PR over the weekend; diagrams will be
            added to the documentation as well.
            <br>
            First, I set up a repository which would hold all of the team's
            source code and documentation; it can be found in the "SOURCE"
            button of the navigation bar above, or
            <a href="https://github.com/alanssitis/smart-air-hockey-table">here</a>.
            This will include technical documentation for our reference,
            microcontroller source code, and also a centralized version control
            for the website. The reason for the addition of the website to the
            repo was because the team encountered permission issues when
            attempting to access the destination over SSH. This is still the
            case as of 09/01/2023 10:18 am.
            <br>
            Second, I contributed extensively to the Final Project Proposal,
            which can be found under <a href="Files/documents.html">"Documents"</a>.
            I wrote the project description, my corresponding team member
            section and wrote the first draft of our PSDRs. These PSDRs were
            then revised to align more closely to the course requirements, but
            each of their functionality remained the same.
            <br>
            Third, me and Ben discussed the feasibility and specifications of
            the table we will be constructing. The consensus was that building
            our own table will give us the most margin of error and the
            flexibility of changing the size and capabilities of the project
            at will. Another notable limitation of using a store-bought
            table was that taking it apart, modeling, and retrofiting the whole
            top would have taken more effort and felt out of scope of the
            project; using an off-the-shelf table would also pigeonhole the
            team to physical constraints that are unknown to us. We also
            decided that the interim playing surface dimensions will be of
            1600mm x 800mm.
            <br>
            Fourth, me and Ben discussed the electronics layout of the
            components that will be under the playing surface. The array which
            will be on each daughter board that will sit under the surface will
            contain 4 Hall Effect sensors and 9 programmable LEDs; this is
            pending a feasibility test. These will be laid down in a 16x8
            matrix under the playing surface, with a "row master" placed at the
            head of one row/column. Each row master will be connected to the
            master microcontroller, which will reside in its own PCB. Goal slot
            sensors will be connected directly to the main PCB, and an
            additional display will be attached to display supplemental
            information such as game score. The precense of a separate
            microcontroller in each daughter board is yet to be determined.
            <br>
            Fifth, me, Ben and Trevor discussed a possible algorithm to track
            the puck. A matrix of low precision (1-bit or 2-bit values) will
            be used to track the "weights" of each sensor. This will then be
            used to compute an estimated position by finding the average of
            all weights (a possible path of optimization is using SIMD
            instructions).
            <br>
            Sixth, I worked on the Functional Description and Theory of
            Operation of the Functional Specification, which can also be found
            in "Documents".
            <br>
            Lastly, I had the chance to play with some LED lights I have. I
            was not able to get much progress, but I am planning to look into
            how the communication protocol is implemented and start building a
            library which the team will then use to control the lights.
